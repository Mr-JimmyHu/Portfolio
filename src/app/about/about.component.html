                am always eager to learn and explore new technologies.
                My major in software engineering has given me a solid
                foundation in the field, and my experience in full-stack development has allowed me to develop a wide
                range of skills. I am passionate about coding and I am always looking for ways to improve and expand my
                knowledge.
